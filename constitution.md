      c. as years, the period of time ends at the beginning of the date of
      the relevant year that corresponds to the date on which the period
      began.

  6. If a period of time prescribed by this Constitution for any purpose
is six days or less, Sundays and public holidays shall not count when

  b. The National Anthem 
         

      Swahili                         English

      1                               1
      Ee Mungu nguvu yetu             O God of all creation
      Ilete baraka kwetu.             Bless this our land and nation.

      Haki iwe ngao na mlinzi         Justice be our shield and defender
      Natukae na undugu               May we dwell in unity

      Amani na uhuru                  Peace and liberty
      Raha tupate na ustawi           Plenty be found within our borders.

      2                               2
      Amkeni ndugu zetu               Let one and all arise
      Tufanye sote bidii              With hearts both strong and true.

      Nasi tujitoe kwa nguvu          Service be our earnest endeavour,
      Nchi yetu ya Kenya,             And our Homeland of Kenya

      Tunayoipenda                    Heritage of splendour,
      Tuwe tayari kuilinda.           Firm may we stand to defend.

      3                               3
      Natujenge taifa letu            Let all with one accord
      Ee, ndio wajibu wetu            In common bond united,

      Kenya istahili heshima          Build this our nation together
      Tuungane mikono                 And the glory of Kenya

      Pamoja kazini                   The fruit of our labour
      Kila siku tuwe na shukrani.     Fill every heart with thanksgiving

ensures good governance, constitutionalism, the rule of law, human

d. promotes the people’s participation in the governance of the
country through democratic, free and fair elections and the devolution
and exercise of power and further ensures the full participation of the
